## Cyclical and Non-Cyclical Businesses ##

***

Businesses can be **cyclical**, i.e. linked to the fluctuations of the economy (or even hyper-cyclical, like luxury goods/pool construction) or **non-cyclical**, i.e. generally profitable regardless of economic trends (or even counter-cyclical, like fast food restaurants).
